## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- Rebranded entire application from "Flatmate Mate" to "FairShare" to shift focus from housing to general group expense sharing.
- Updated database collections in `database.json`: `houses` -> `groups`, `flatmates` -> `members`.

- Renamed and migrated `/api/flatmates.js` to `/api/members.js`.
- Refactored `/api/setup` to instantiate Organizer role and create Group collections.
- Refactored `/api/auth` and `/api/auth-helper.js` using Group and Member terminology.

- Rebranded client UI in `index.html` and selectors in `index.css`.
- Renamed and updated frontend JS modules `app.js` and `api-client.js` with zero traces of housing-centric terms.
- Updated CSV exporting engine `export.js` and integration test suite `scratch/test-api.js` to assert rebranded behaviors.
